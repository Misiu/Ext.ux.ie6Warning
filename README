 = Ext.ux.ie6Warning =

This UX was inspired by  www.ie6nomore.com

ExtJS 4.x supports IE6, but that doesn't mean we should encourage people to use it.

Ext.ux.ie6Warning will display a banner for users running IE6 to upgrade their browser.



= Other Stuff =

I use the Sencha SDK Tools to compress/minify the code. It must be used in conjunction with ExtJS 4.x, which is not included in this repo/download.
